    description: "Room is a cross between Among Us and Mario Party. Large groups recommended. Review: Hater is not an Escape Game that impresses with a great scenery – many of the puzzles and tasks are rather simple in construction – BUT, if you are up for an unusual and fast-paced challenge, in which there is a lot to laugh about, you will get your money’s worth in this game. An absolutely deserved 2nd place in the category “Most Original Game” at the Escape Room Awards 2022!",
